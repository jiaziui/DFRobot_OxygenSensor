@brief Obtain the lifespan of the sensor probe.
@n step: we must first determine the iic device address, will dial the code switch A0, A1 (ADDRESS_0 for [0 0]), (ADDRESS_1 for [1 0]), (ADDRESS_2 for [0 1]), (ADDRESS_3 for [1 1]).
@n note: The old version of the sensor cannot use the "check_probel_life" API
@n The experimental phenomenon is to print the life status of the sensor probe on the serial port.
@n The longer the oxygen sensor probe is used, the lower the measurement accuracy will be. The probe can be replaced for repair.
